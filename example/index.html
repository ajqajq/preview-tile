                    The domestic cat[1][5] (Latin: Felis catus) or the feral cat[5][3] (Latin: Felis silvestris catus) is a small, typically
                    furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when
                    there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.[6] Cats are often valued by humans
                    for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds; different
                    associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. Cats are similar in anatomy to
                    the other felids, with a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted
                    to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds
                    too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.
                    They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense
                    of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication
                    includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting),
                    as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[7]

                    The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)[2] is a domesticated canine which has been selectively bred
                    over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[3] Although initially
                    thought to have originated as an artificial variant of an extant canid species (variously supposed as
                    being the dhole,[4] golden jackal,[5] or gray wolf[6]), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the
                    2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago.[7] Their
                    long association with humans has led to dogs being uniquely attuned to human behavior[8] and are able
                    to thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species.[9] Dogs are also the
                    oldest domesticated animal. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colours.[10] Dogs perform many roles
                    for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship
                    and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This influence on human society has given them the
                    sobriquet, "man's best friend".

                    A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly
                    tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus).
                    It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known
                    to invade homes for food and shelter. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from
                    the common house mouse. This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild.
                    The most well known strain, the white lab mouse, has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its
                    use in research. The American white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the deer mouse (Peromyscus
                    maniculatus), as well as other common species of mouse-like rodents around the world, also sometimes
                    live in houses. These, however, are in other genera. Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and
                    even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of
                    its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian
                    genera living on Earth today. Mice can at times be vermin, damaging and eating crops,[1] causing structural
                    damage and spreading diseases through their parasites and feces.[2] In North America, breathing dust
                    that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus
                    pulmonary syndrome (HPS).
